REWORK NOTES

- TLC output 2 is dead on board 01
- All TLC outputs dead on board 00
- Boards 01-02 need ULN rework


---------------------------------------------


SW NEED:
- add SW reset
- do state values need to be declared const in classes
- progmem for timing array


---------------------------------------------


NOTES FOR 11/04

Cocoons
	- Sleep Mode - Some, but not all cocoons take short breathes with a dim LED. All cocoons will eventually take a breath, but few will be moving at the same time.
	- Awake Mode - All cocoons breathe with increasing frequency and intensity of LED. 'Wait delay' of each cocoon converges on some number, so eventually they're all going at once.

Audio 
	- Chirp noise will occur periodically in sleep mode.
	- In awake mode chirp frequency decreases and drone frequency increases to be constant eventually.
		-> best way to include current functions into loop timing?

Motion Detector 
	- Make sure super cool new code works...does not trigger when it's not supposed to.
		-> can detach and re-attach interrupt correctly without affecting timing

Spiders
	- Had to spend some serious time thinking about how to keep track of the location of the spider. 
	- Make sure that up and down funtions perform correctly
	-> Integrate with rest of timing routine. 
	- Finally, check out why fans don't work.
